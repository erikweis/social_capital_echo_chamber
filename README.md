# social_capital_echo_chamber
The write-up for this project is can be found [here](https://github.com/erikweis/social_capital_echo_chamber/blob/master/social_capital_echo_chambers.ipynb). This project explores the opinion dynamics of continuous-variable opinion-dynamics on a configuration-model network. The model has four main features:
1. Social influence with bounded confidence
2. Probabilistic re-wiring of edges to nodes outside the bounded confidence range
3. Posting/reposting messages based on the content of a screen
4. Expression of a socially influenced 'public opinion' which may differ from a private belief

This model is an extension/modification of the model described here:
