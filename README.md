# social_capital_echo_chamber
Explores the opinion dynamics of a continuous-variable opinion on a configuration-model network. The model has three main features:
1. Social influence with bounded confidence
2. Probabilistic re-wiring of edges to nodes outside the bounded confidence range
3. Posting/reposting messages based on the content of a screen
3. Expression of a socially influenced 'public opinion' which may differ from a private belief

This model is an extension/modification of the model described here:
